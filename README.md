# Small-projects

This repo contains some small projects with applications of CNN, GAN and so on. In particular:
- CNN for peumonia/normal binary classification (EffecientNet fine tuning). The dataset is [Penumonia Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) Credits to the [coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/projects/pneumonia-classification-using-pytorch);
- CNN for viral pneumonia/covid-19 classification/normal classification (ResNet18 fine tuning). The dataset is [COVID-19 Radiography Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database) on Kaggle. Credits to the [coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/projects/covid-19-detection-x-ray);
- model for Object localization. Credits to the [coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-learning-with-pytorch--object-localization);
- GAN for creating MNIST numbers. Credits to the [coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-learning-with-pytorch-generative-adversarial-network). The dataset is the standard MNIST dataset from torchvision;
- CNN to distinguish facial expressions. The images are taken from this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jonathanoheix/face-expression-recognition-dataset).
- CNN to distinguish animals: crows, rats, bears and elephants. The images are taken from this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ikjotsingh221/animal-dataset) from kaggle. Here there is an example of saliency map and implementation of early stopping;
- ML and DL project to distinguish between breast cancer or not. The dataset is the ususal [breast cancer Winconsin](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data) from kaggle. Credits to the [Coursera project](https://www.coursera.org/learn/breast-cancer-prediction-using-machine-learning) and [Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-networks-with-pytorch).
