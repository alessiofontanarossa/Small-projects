# Small-projects

This repo contains some small projects with applications of CNN, GAN and so on. In particular:
- CNN for peumonia/normal binary classification (EffecientNet fine tuning). The dataset is [Penumonia Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) Credits to the [coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/projects/pneumonia-classification-using-pytorch);
- CNN for viral pneumonia/covid-19 classification/normal classification (ResNet18 fine tuning). The dataset is [COVID-19 Radiography Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database) on Kaggle. Credits to the [coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/projects/covid-19-detection-x-ray);
- model for Object localization. Credits to the [coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-learning-with-pytorch--object-localization);
- GAN for creating MNIST numbers. Credits to the [coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-learning-with-pytorch-generative-adversarial-network). The dataset is the standard MNIST dataset from torchvision.
