# Small-projects

This repo contains some small projects with applications of CNN, GAN and so on.  

## PyTorch:

- <span style="background-color: yellow">**Pneumonia_Classification**</span> CNN for peumonia/normal binary classification (EffecientNet fine-tuning). The dataset is [Penumonia Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) Credits to the [Coursera project](https://www.coursera.org/projects/pneumonia-classification-using-pytorch);
- <span style="background-color: yellow">**Covid-19 classification**</span> CNN for viral pneumonia/covid-19 classification/normal classification (ResNet18 fine tuning). The dataset is [COVID-19 Radiography Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database) on Kaggle. Credits to the [Coursera project](https://www.coursera.org/projects/covid-19-detection-x-ray);
- <span style="background-color: yellow">**Object Localization**</span> Model for Object localization. Credits to the [Coursera project](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-learning-with-pytorch--object-localization);
- <span style="background-color: yellow">**Generative Adversarial Network**</span> GAN for creating MNIST numbers. Credits to the [Coursera project](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-learning-with-pytorch-generative-adversarial-network). The dataset is the standard MNIST dataset from torchvision;
- <span style="background-color: yellow">**Facial Expressions**</span> CNN to distinguish facial expressions. The images are taken from this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jonathanoheix/face-expression-recognition-dataset);
- <span style="background-color: yellow">**Tasks and YOLO**</span> Computer vision tasks (also with YOLO). Credits to [OpenCV](https://courses.opencv.org) free PyTorch bootcamp.

The most refined projects are:
- <span style="background-color: yellow">**Animal-dataset**</span> CNN to distinguish animals: crows, rats, bears and elephants. The images are taken from this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ikjotsingh221/animal-dataset) from kaggle. Here there is an example of saliency map and implementation of early stopping;
- <span style="background-color: yellow">**Breast Cancer Dataset**</span> ML and DL project to distinguish between breast cancer or not. The dataset is the ususal [breast cancer Winconsin](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data) from kaggle. Credits to the [Coursera project](https://www.coursera.org/learn/breast-cancer-prediction-using-machine-learning) and [Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-networks-with-pytorch).

## Keras/TensorFlow:

- <span style="background-color: yellow">**Waste_classification**</span> CNN for recyclable/organic binary classification. Credits to the [Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/building-deep-learning-models-with-tensorflow);
